🎯 Purpose of This Module

This controller performs raw LiDAR-based perception for the robot.
It extracts structured detection data from LiDAR and prepares it for:

Kalman-based human motion prediction (Waleed’s module)

Adaptive DWA safety logic

Collision avoidance and human-aware navigation

This is the first stage of the perception pipeline.

🧠 What This Module Does

Reads LiDAR scan (LDS-01 device).

Converts ranges → polar + Cartesian coordinates (x, y).

Packages each valid LiDAR return as a detection point.

Sends detection data to the next stage (Kalman Tracker).

(Optional extension) Performs clustering to group points into objects.

This module does not move the robot — it only senses.
